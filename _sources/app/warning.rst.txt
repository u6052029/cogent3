Warning -- apps are alpha!
--------------------------

The apps are written using built-in capabilities of ``cogent3``. These underpinnings are thoroughly tested. However, the app interface should be considered alpha-level code. We are still exploring how best to implement these capabilities. So you should expect bugs. When ``cogent3`` is released as ``beta``, the interface will be more stable. From that point, any significant changes to the interface will be preceded by deprecation warnings.

*But we are still in alpha ...!*
