Building A Phylogenetic Tree From Pairwise Distances
====================================================

Directly via ``alignment.quick_tree()``
=======================================

Both the ``ArrayAlignment`` and ``Alignment`` classes support this.

.. doctest::

    >>> from cogent3 import load_aligned_seqs
    >>> aln = load_aligned_seqs('data/primate_brca1.fasta', moltype="dna")
    >>> tree = aln.quick_tree(calc="TN93")
    >>> tree = tree.balanced()  # purely for display
    >>> print(tree.ascii_art())  #doctest: +SKIP
                        /-Rhesus
              /edge.1--|
             |         |          /-HowlerMon
             |          \edge.0--|
             |                    \-Galago
    -root----|
             |--Orangutan
             |
             |          /-Chimpanzee
              \edge.2--|
                       |          /-Human
                        \edge.3--|
                                  \-Gorilla


The ``quick_tree()`` method also supports non-parametric bootstrapping. The number of resampled alignments is specified using the ``bootstrap`` argument. In the following, trees are estimated from 100 resampled alignments and merged into a single consensus topology using a weighted consensus tree algorithm.

.. doctest::
    
    >>> tree = aln.quick_tree(calc="TN93", bootstrap=100)


Using the ``DistanceMatrix`` object
-----------------------------------

.. doctest::

    >>> from cogent3 import load_aligned_seqs
    >>> aln = load_aligned_seqs('data/primate_brca1.fasta', moltype="dna")
    >>> dists = aln.distance_matrix(calc="TN93")
    >>> tree = dists.quick_tree()
    >>> tree = tree.balanced()  # purely for display
    >>> print(tree.ascii_art())  #doctest: +SKIP
                        /-Rhesus
              /edge.1--|
             |         |          /-HowlerMon
             |          \edge.0--|
             |                    \-Galago
    -root----|
             |--Orangutan
             |
             |          /-Chimpanzee
              \edge.2--|
                       |          /-Human
                        \edge.3--|
                                  \-Gorilla

Explicitly via ``DistanceMatrix`` and ``cogent3.phylo.nj.nj()```
----------------------------------------------------------------

.. doctest::

    >>> from cogent3.phylo import nj
    >>> from cogent3 import load_aligned_seqs
    >>> aln = load_aligned_seqs('data/primate_brca1.fasta', moltype="dna")
    >>> dists = aln.distance_matrix(calc="TN93")
    >>> tree = nj.nj(dists)
    >>> tree = tree.balanced()  # purely for display
    >>> print(tree.ascii_art())  #doctest: +SKIP
                        /-Rhesus
              /edge.1--|
             |         |          /-HowlerMon
             |          \edge.0--|
             |                    \-Galago
    -root----|
             |--Orangutan
             |
             |          /-Chimpanzee
              \edge.2--|
                       |          /-Human
                        \edge.3--|
                                  \-Gorilla


Directly from a pairwise distance ``dict``
------------------------------------------

.. doctest::

    >>> from cogent3.phylo import nj
    >>> dists = {('a', 'b'): 2.7, ('c', 'b'): 2.33, ('c', 'a'): 0.73}
    >>> tree = nj.nj(dists)
    >>> print(tree.ascii_art())  #doctest: +SKIP
              /-a
             |
    -root----|--b
             |
              \-c

By Least-squares
================

We illustrate the phylogeny reconstruction by least-squares using the F81 substitution model. We use the advanced-stepwise addition algorithm to search tree space. Here ``a`` is the number of taxa to exhaustively evaluate all possible phylogenies for. Successive taxa are added to the top ``k`` trees (measured by the least-squares metric) and ``k`` trees are kept at each iteration.

.. doctest::

    >>> from cogent3.util.deserialise import deserialise_object
    >>> from cogent3.phylo.least_squares import WLS
    >>> dists = deserialise_object('data/dists_for_phylo.json')
    >>> ls = WLS(dists)
    >>> stat, tree = ls.trex(a=5, k=5, show_progress=False)

Other optional arguments that can be passed to the ``trex`` method are: ``return_all``, whether the ``k`` best trees at the final step are returned as a ``ScoredTreeCollection`` object; ``order``, a series of tip names whose order defines the sequence in which tips will be added during tree building (this allows the user to randomise the input order).

By ML
=====

We illustrate the phylogeny reconstruction using maximum-likelihood using the F81 substitution model. We use the advanced-stepwise addition algorithm to search tree space.

.. doctest::

    >>> from cogent3 import load_aligned_seqs
    >>> from cogent3.phylo.maximum_likelihood import ML
    >>> from cogent3.evolve.models import F81
    >>> aln = load_aligned_seqs('data/primate_brca1.fasta')
    >>> ml = ML(F81(), aln)

The ``ML`` object also has the ``trex`` method and this can be used in the same way as for above, i.e. ``ml.trex()``. We don't do that here because this is a very slow method for phylogenetic reconstruction.
